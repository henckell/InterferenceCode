# InterferenceCode

R-code for "A Graphical Approach to Treatment Effect Estimation with Observational Network Data"

## Main simulation

- Simulation investigating the empirical RMSE, bias and variance of the proposed estimator in a variety of settings.

## Maximal degree simulation

- Simulation investigating the maximal degree of the interference graph for the feature fraction of treated parents and different Erdos-Reyni graph regimes.

## Estimator

- Implimentation of our proposed estimator.

## Masking policy in Switzerland analysis

- Unfortunately we cannot yet make our data and analysis public. We add both to this repository as soon as possible.
